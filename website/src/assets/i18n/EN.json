  "INTRO_TEXT": "I am a passionate software engineering student at the Faculty of Science Tunis (FST) with a strong foundation in problem-solving and a keen interest in web development. In my first year, I achieved an excellent average. With a focus on software development, I have successfully completed several projects, including a web redesign, library management software, a full-stack web application for hotel management, a 2D platform game, a program for creating encrypted QR codes, and an AWS cloud solution for hosting 3-tier web apps. These experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set in Java, JavaScript, Python, and C#, as well as experience with services like AWS and frameworks like Angular, React and Spring Boot. With a dedication to continuous growth, I actively participate in sports and programming-related online courses. I am driven to seek new challenges, expand my knowledge, and contribute to the field of software engineering.",
